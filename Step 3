The result of step 3
Due to the laptop construction and colab have to pay to get gpu thus i use cpu and the loss at iteration down from 5000 to 50 
# Validation Loss vs. Number of Layers (n_head=5)

- X-axis: Number of Layers [2, 3, 5, 7]
- Y-axis: Validation Loss at Iteration 50 [1.50, 1.44, 1.45, 1.46]
- Plot Type: Line plot with circle markers

Description:
- The plot shows a line connecting four points corresponding to n_layer={2, 3, 5, 7} with n_head=5.
- The validation loss starts at 1.50 (n_layer=2), dips to a minimum of 1.44 (n_layer=3), slightly rises to 1.45 (n_layer=5), and then to 1.46 (n_layer=7).
- The trend suggests that n_layer=3 achieves the lowest validation loss, while deeper layers (n_layer=7) slightly increase the loss.
