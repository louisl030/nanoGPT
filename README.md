# SEEM3650 Practical Exam 2 babychatgpt 
nanoGPT
Descripe: Explore training GPT models using the nanoGPT repository. While
training functioning GPT models typically requires multiple GPUs, we will work with a much smaller
version, referred to as BabyGPT. This can be trained on a CPU, though using a GPU (e.g., via Google
Colab) is recommended for faster results.
